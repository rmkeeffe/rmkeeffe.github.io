    abstract = "{During feeding in many terrestrial vertebrates, the tongue acts in concert with the hyoid and pectoral girdle. In frogs, these three elements are interconnected by musculature. While the feeding mechanics of the anuran tongue are well-studied, little is known of how the motions of the tongue relate to the movements of the skeleton or how buccal structures move following closure of the mouth. Although features such as the pectoral girdle and hyoid are not externally visible in frogs, their motions can be tracked in X-ray video. We used XROMM (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology) techniques to track the 3D movements of the tongue, hyoid apparatus, pectoral girdle, skull, and jaw during the feeding cycle of the cane toad, Rhinella marina. We show how the movements of these elements are integrated during tongue protrusion and prey capture, as well as during prey transport, swallowing, and recovery. Our findings suggest that the hyoid apparatus is important both for prey manipulation and swallowing. The tongue consistently stretches posterior to the skull during swallowing, often more than it stretches during protrusion to reach the prey. Feeding kinematics are similar between individuals, and the kinematics of unsuccessful strikes generally resemble those of successful strikes. Our data also provide a new perspective on the potential role of the pectoral girdle, an element with a predominant locomotor function, during feeding events. This work raises new questions about the evolution of feeding in frogs, as well as how the diversity of pectoral and buccal anatomy observed across anurans may influence feeding kinematics.}",

    abstract = "{Burrowing is one of the many locomotor modes of frogs (order Anura) and is found within many clades. Burrowing is generally categorized into two groups; forward-burrowing and backward-burrowing. While forward-burrowing is more rare than backward-burrowing, we show that it has evolved independently at least eight times across anurans and is correlated with distinct features of the external and internal anatomy. The shape of the humerus is especially important for forward-burrowing, as many species use their forelimbs for digging. Using X-ray computed tomography data, we characterize shape variation in the humerus, including three-dimensional (3D) morphometrics, assess the morphology of muscles related to this variation in the humerus, and discuss the mechanical and evolutionary consequences of our results. We show that the humeri of most forward-burrowing frogs are morphologically distinct from those of non-forward-burrowers, including features such as a curved and thick diaphysis, the presence of a pronounced ventral crest, and relatively large epicondyles and humeral head. Our findings also suggest that pectoral muscle anatomy differs substantially among burrowing modes in frogs. This work provides a framework for predicting locomotor modes in taxa for which the natural history is poorly known as well as extinct taxa.}",

abstract = {Teeth are present in most clades of vertebrates but have been lost completely several times in actinopterygian fishes and amniotes. Using phenotypic data collected from over 500 genera via micro-computed tomography, we provide the first rigorous assessment of the evolutionary history of dentition across all major lineages of amphibians. We demonstrate that dentition is invariably present in caecilians and salamanders, but teeth have been lost completely more than 20 times in frogs, a much higher occurrence of edentulism than in any other vertebrate group. The repeated loss of teeth in anurans is associated with a specialized diet of small invertebrate prey as well as shortening of the lower jaw, but it is not correlated with a reduction in body size. Frogs provide an unparalleled opportunity for investigating the molecular and developmental mechanisms of convergent tooth loss on a large phylogenetic scale.},

    abstract = "{The evolution of novel functional traits can contribute substantially to the diversification of lineages. Older functional traits might show greater variation than more recently evolved novelties, due to the accrual of evolutionary changes through time. However, functional complexity and many-to-one mapping of structure to function could complicate such expectations. In this context, we compared kinematics and performance across juveniles from multiple species for two styles of waterfall-climbing that are novel to gobiid fishes; ancestral “powerburst” climbing, and more recently evolved “inching”, which has been confirmed only among species of a single genus that is nested within the clade of powerburst climbers. Similar net climbing speeds across inching species seem, at first, to indicate that this more recently evolved mode of climbing exhibits less functional diversity. However, these similar net speeds arise through different pathways; Sicyopterus stimpsoni from Hawai’i move more slowly than S. lagocephalus from La Réunion, but may also spend more time moving. The production of similar performance between multiple functional pathways reflects a situation that resembles the phenomenon of many-to-one mapping of structure to function. Such similarity has the potential to mask appropriate interpretations of relative functional diversity between lineages, unless the mechanisms underlying performance are explored. More specifically, similarity in net performance between “powerburst” and “inching” styles indicates that selection on climbing performance was likely a limited factor in promoting the evolution of inching as a new mode of climbing. In this context, other processes (e.g., exaptation) might be implicated in the origin of this functional novelty.}",
