My ongoing research involves examining the functional morphology and evolution of vertebrate animals. I leverage morphological, biomechanical, and comparative methods to understand broad patterns of evolution.

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching in both higher education and outreach settings. My public outreach work highlights the importance of organismal biology, conservation, and natural history museums. Currently, I am collaborating with Dr. Patricia Brennan on her NSF CAREER grant regarding the evolution of snakes as a postdoctoral research fellow at Mount Holyoke College.

My previous work experience includes managing long-term research projects, data analysis, written and oral communication, and digital illustration.
