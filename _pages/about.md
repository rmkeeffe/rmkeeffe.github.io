My ongoing research involves examining the functional morphology and evolution of vertebrate animals. I leverage morphological, biomechanical, and comparative methods to understand broad patterns of evolution.

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching in both higher education and outreach settings. My public outreach work highlights the importance of organismal biology, conservation, and natural history museums. Currently, I am collaborating with <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/directory/faculty-staff/patty-brennan">Dr. Patricia Brennan</a> on her <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2042260">NSF CAREER grant</a> regarding the evolution of snakes as a postdoctoral research fellow at <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/">Mount Holyoke College</a>.

My previous work experience includes managing long-term research projects, data analysis, written and oral communication, and digital illustration.
